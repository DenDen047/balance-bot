###Balance Bot

v0.01

This is an environment for [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) where the goal is to train a controller for a two-wheeled balancing robot. The aim is to stay upright as long as possible, and maintain desired speed (by default zero, ie stationary).

For more information on how to setup and train a model take a look at [this blog post](https://backyardrobotics.eu/2017/11/27/build-a-balancing-bot-with-openai-gym-pt-i-setting-up/).
